This is my Python Project. I wanted my project to be on a random lyric mix and match because I listen to music most of the time whenever I am doing something by myself. I also
chose to only use happy lyrics because I wanted to express that there is something out there that can help someone feel happier in times of need, whether it be a person or an
inanimate object or even a bot.

I had some struggles getting this program to run. Some problems that I ran into was finding out to to randomly match the lists, and how to set a 
time interval for when the program should produce another mix and match. Another problem that I encountered was when I tried to split a list, but I can only split a string.
Therefore, I had to make a list containing the first half of lyrics that I wanted to randomly mix with the second half of another lyric. 

My time interval for when the bot produces another lyric is once every 972 seconds. I chose this number because I found that an average of 16.2 million adults in the Unites
States have depression. I multiplied that number by 60 then divided it by 1 million because I wanted to represent every 1 million people as a minute.
